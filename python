""" Implement a program that takes a text string as input and determines the smallest and largest ASCII characters present in the text using the min() and max() functions. 



You should find the ASCII values for each character in the string and identify the smallest and largest among them.

Input format :
The input consists of a single line of input containing a text string.

Output format :
The first line prints "Smallest ASCII Value: " followed by the smallest ASCII value of the character found in the text.

The second line prints "Largest ASCII Value: " followed by the largest ASCII value of the character found in the text.

"""


text = input()

smallest_ascii = min(ord(char) for char in text)
largest_ascii = max(ord(char) for char in text)

print(f"Smallest ASCII Value: {smallest_ascii}")
print(f"Largest ASCII Value: {largest_ascii}")
